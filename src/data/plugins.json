Computers were invented to let us work less and spend more time watching kitten videos, so get ready to reclaim some of your precious time back.\n\nSketch Generator will let you export all your assets, no matter how complex your design, with a single keystroke. Forget about slicing, exporting, or moving files manually: welcome to the future, where everything that can be made automatically is made automatically :)"
